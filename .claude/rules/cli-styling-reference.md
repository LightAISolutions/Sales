# CLI Accent Styling Reference

*Path-scoped: auto-injects when editing `chat-bookends.md`, `chat-bookends-reference.md`, `output-formatting.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` — the files where formatting decisions are actually made. Cross-referenced from `output-formatting.md`.*

> **"Make it red" = backtick-wrap it.** Whenever the user asks to make text, labels, dividers, or any element "red" or "colored" in the CLI, the answer is **always** backtick-wrapping (`` `text` ``). This is the only reliable method for red/accent styling. Do not attempt bare Unicode characters, HTML tags, or any other approach — they do not work. Backtick-wrapping works on any text content: labels, dividers, status indicators, headers, etc.

The Claude Code CLI renders certain markdown constructs with colored/accented styling that can be used intentionally for visual emphasis in chat output. This section documents what works and what doesn't, based on empirical testing.

## What triggers colored/accent styling

| Construct | Styling | Where it works | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Backtick-wrapped text (`` `text` ``) | **Red/accent** with bordered background | Inside and outside blockquotes | `` > `Label Text` `` |
| Code-inside-link (`` [`text`](url) ``) | **Red/accent** on the code portion, clickable | Inside and outside blockquotes | `` > [`Homepage`](https://...) `` |
| Bare `─` box-drawing line (15+ chars) | **Unreliable — may not render red** | Theoretically outside blockquotes only, but not consistently observed | `───────────────` |
| Diff code block — `+` lines | **Green** syntax highlighting | Fenced code block with `diff` language | `` ```diff `` then `+ added line` |
| Diff code block — `-` lines | **Red** syntax highlighting | Fenced code block with `diff` language | `` ```diff `` then `- removed line` |
| Colored emoji sequences | **Native emoji color** (red, yellow, green, etc.) | Anywhere | `🔴🟡🟢🟥⬛` |
| Checkboxes (`- [x]`, `- [ ]`) | Rendered checkbox with visual checked/unchecked state | Inside and outside blockquotes | `> - [x] Done` / `> - [ ] Pending` |
| Language-hinted code blocks | **Multi-color** syntax highlighting (strings, keys, values) | Fenced code blocks with language hint | `` ```python ``, `` ```json ``, `` ```yaml `` |

## What does NOT trigger styling

| Construct | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Bare `─` box-drawing line (< 15 chars) | Plain white | Minimum length threshold not met |
| Bare `─` inside blockquotes | Plain white | Blockquote context suppresses the red treatment |
| Spaced `─` characters (`─ ─ ─ ─`) | Plain white | Spaces break detection |
| Other box-drawing chars (`━`, `┄`, `╌`, `╍`, `┅`) | Plain white | Only `─` (U+2500) triggers it |
| `· · · · ·` (middle dots) | Plain white | No special treatment |
| HTML tags (`<span style>`, `<mark>`, `<sub>`, etc.) | Plain text — tags visible | CLI does not interpret inline HTML |
| GitHub alert syntax (`[!NOTE]`, `[!WARNING]`) | Plain text | CLI does not support admonition rendering |
| Bold/italic wrapping code (`**\`text\`**`, `*\`text\`*`) | Same as plain backtick | No additional styling from bold/italic wrapper |
| Strikethrough (`~~text~~`) | Plain text | No dimming or gray effect |
| Definition lists (`: text`) | Plain text | No special rendering |
| LaTeX/math (`$E=mc^2$`, `$$...$$`) | Plain text | CLI does not render math notation |
| `<kbd>` tags | Plain text — tags visible | CLI does not interpret keyboard key HTML |
| Unicode symbols (`▶`, `◉`, `⊕`, `⟫`, `❯`) | Plain white text | No color treatment — rendered but unstyled |

## Key findings
- **Backtick wrapping is the most reliable method** — it works both inside and outside blockquotes with consistent red/accent styling
- **Code-inside-link** (`` [`text`](url) ``) gives you red accent styling that is also a clickable link — useful when you want a label that navigates somewhere
- **Diff code blocks** are the only way to get **green** text — use `` ```diff `` with `+` prefixed lines. Also produces red for `-` prefixed lines (distinct from the backtick red — this is syntax highlighting red)
- **Colored emoji** are the only way to get arbitrary colors (red, yellow, green, black, etc.) — they render at native emoji color regardless of context
- **Checkboxes** (`- [x]` / `- [ ]`) render with visual checked/unchecked state — useful for progress indicators or checklists within formatted output
- **Language-hinted code blocks** (`` ```python ``, `` ```json ``, `` ```yaml ``) produce multi-color syntax highlighting — different colors for strings, keys, values, keywords
- The bare `─` (U+2500) character was theorized to get red styling outside blockquotes, but this is **unreliable in practice** — use backtick-wrapping (`` `─────────────────────────` ``) for guaranteed red/accent styling on divider lines
- This is a **Claude Code CLI rendering behavior** — these styles do not appear on GitHub, VS Code markdown preview, or other markdown renderers

## Recommended patterns

**Color techniques:**
- **Red labels/headers**: `` > `Label Text` `` — backtick-wrapped text in blockquotes for section headers (used in Unaffected/Affected URLs)
- **Red clickable labels**: `` > [`Label`](url) `` — code-inside-link for accent-styled labels that also navigate somewhere
- **Green text**: `` ```diff `` with `+ text` lines — the only way to produce green in the CLI
- **Red text (alt)**: `` ```diff `` with `- text` lines — syntax-highlighted red (different shade from backtick red)
- **Colored bars/indicators**: emoji sequences (`🔴🟡🟢⬛🟥`) — arbitrary color through native emoji rendering
- **Status indicators**: `` > `✏️ Modified` `` or `` > `✅ Complete` `` — combine emoji with accent styling for maximum visibility
- **Multi-color syntax blocks**: `` ```python `` / `` ```json `` / `` ```yaml `` — richly colored output for structured data or code snippets

**Interactive/state techniques:**
- **Progress checklists**: `> - [x] Step 1 done` / `> - [ ] Step 2 pending` — visual checked/unchecked indicators

**Structural techniques:**
- **Sub-grouping**: `>>` nested blockquotes — create visual hierarchy within a blockquoted block
- **Structured data**: markdown tables inside blockquotes — present tabular information with the blockquote's left-border context
- **Visual weight/density**: unicode block chars (`▓░▒■◆`) — create visual separators or indicators with more presence than standard text
- **General rule**: whenever you need text to visually "pop" inside a blockquote, wrap it in backticks. For structural separation, use nested blockquotes or tables

## Where this is currently used
- **End-of-response block header** — `` `─────────────────────────` `` + `` `END OF RESPONSE BLOCK` `` + `` `─────────────────────────` `` uses backtick-wrapping to render the dividers and header in red/accent, visually separating work phases from the end-of-response block
- **Unaffected/Affected URLs sections** — all labels (`Template Repo`, `Repository`, `Homepage`, `✏️ Homepage`, etc.) use backtick-wrapped text on their own line to create red "headers" above each URL entry

## Other useful formatting constructs
These don't trigger color styling, but provide distinct visual structure in the CLI that can be used intentionally:

| Construct | Visual effect | Use case | Example |
|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Nested blockquote levels (`>>`, `>>>`) | Progressively indented with stacked left borders | Visual hierarchy, sub-grouping within blockquoted content | `>> indented sub-item` |
| Markdown table inside blockquote | Renders as a formatted table with borders inside the blockquote | Structured data display within blockquoted sections | `> \| Col A \| Col B \|` |
| Unicode block characters (`▓`, `░`, `▒`, `■`, `◆`) | Dense visual blocks — distinct texture from standard text | Progress bars, visual separators, density indicators | `> ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░` |

## Known limitations

**Image alt text (`![text](url)`)** — as of 2026-02-25, the Claude Code CLI does **not** render inline images. The `![alt](url)` syntax renders as a "Show image" clickable button that opens the URL in an external browser when clicked. The alt text itself is not visually displayed in the terminal. This is a known limitation — open feature requests exist (GitHub issues #2266 and #6389) for terminal graphics protocol support (Sixel, Kitty, iTerm2), but none have been implemented. The underlying `ink` (React for CLIs) framework does not natively support image rendering. **Do not use `![alt](url)` for styling purposes** unless the CLI adds inline image support in the future — check the feature requests for status updates before relying on this construct
