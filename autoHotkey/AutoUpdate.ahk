WM_AHK_RELOAD := 0x0500                              ; WM_USER + 256

; === Manual targets (local-only scratchpad, gitignored) ===
; Developers can add targets through the Manual Targets panel embedded in the
; main window; entries persist to AutoUpdate.manual-targets.ini and load
; alongside the hardcoded self target so they're actually polled + updated
; locally before being handed off to Claude for official integration via the
; "Copy for Claude" button.
MANUAL_TARGETS_INI := A_ScriptDir "\AutoUpdate.manual-targets.ini"

; === Manifest (repo-tracked active auto-update targets) ===
; auto-update-targets.ini lives in the repo and lists every script that's
; currently being auto-updated. For each entry the manifest carries the
; remote/version paths and reload flags; the per-machine local path is NOT
; stored here — it's resolved at runtime by joining each manifest entry
; with a [localpath:<Name>] entry in LOCALPATHS_PATH (per-machine
; persisted; promoted from an intent on first sight). This keeps
; repo-shared config and per-machine config cleanly separated.
MANIFEST_PATH := A_ScriptDir "\auto-update-targets.ini"

; === Local paths (persisted per-machine target locations) ===
; AutoUpdate.localpaths.ini holds [localpath:<Name>] sections, one per
; integrated manifest target, each storing the local folder where this
; machine wants the target file written. Auto-populated when a manifest
; entry first appears with a matching [intent:<Name>] in the wishlist —
; AutoUpdate "promotes" the intent's localFolder into a localpath entry
; and deletes the intent. Also populated by the "Edit Path…" button on
; the status table. Survives intent removal so deleting wishlist items
; (which the GUI presents as a disposable queue) is safe by design.
LOCALPATHS_PATH := A_ScriptDir "\AutoUpdate.localpaths.ini"

; === GUI layout constants ===
; The main window is a two-column layout: LEFT = monitoring (countdown,
; status table, log, action buttons), RIGHT = manual targets (heading, help,
; list, form, action buttons). Footer spans full width below both columns.
; Centralizing the column geometry here keeps BuildGui + BuildManualTargets-
; Section in sync — change COL_W once and both columns retune.
COL_W       := 620                                   ; px — both columns
COL_GAP     := 20                                    ; px — between columns
RIGHT_COL_X := 10 + COL_W + COL_GAP                  ; ≈ 650 (xm + col1 + gap)
FULL_W      := COL_W * 2 + COL_GAP                   ; ≈ 1260 (footer span)

; Manifest entries with neither a localpath nor an intent are still pushed

; ─── Intents (pre-handoff wishlist) ──────────────────────────────────────
; Manual Targets entries are now "intents" — pending AHK scripts the

; the future script should land on this machine. Intents are persisted to
; AutoUpdate.manual-targets.ini under [intent:Name] sections; they NEVER
; enter the live TARGETS array (no polling, no fetching). They're consumed
; only by the Copy-for-Claude button, which assembles them into a self-
; contained handoff prompt.

; INI values are line-based (key=value, one per line) and can't span
; newlines natively — IniWrite would truncate at the first `\n`. The intent
; description is multi-line, so we encode newlines as a literal ||N||
; sentinel before writing and decode back when reading. The sentinel is
; uncommon enough in natural prose that collisions are practically zero.

; of `true` is true, and anything else (including blank, `false`, `False`,
; `0`, garbage) is false. Keep the helper narrow — only `true`/anything
